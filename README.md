# Luftdaten-Notification
This script can be used with a respirable dust sensor by [Luftdaten.info](http://luftdaten.info/). You have to know the ID of your sensor. The script uses their [API](http://api.luftdaten.info).

## Telegram
If your sensor value exceeds a limit you will get a message by a Telegram bot. He is called [@LuftdatenBot](http://t.me/LuftdatenBot)  
[Here you can learn how to configure it.](https://github.com/Lanseuo/Luftdaten-Notification/blob/master/telegram-configuration.md)


### Sensor-ID
Every respirable dust sensor has it's own ID. It can be found on the [map](http://maps.luftdaten.info/).
